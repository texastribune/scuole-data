# scuole-data

A repository of data sets used in the [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole) project. When updating the [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole) database, this is where you download, clean and save the data. The scripts found in [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole) will then upload each dataset directly from this folder into the database.

Before you start the update process in the [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole), make sure all of the data files needed for the update are clean and ready to go.

We try to update every year in January after the latest TAPR data is released at the end of the previous year. However, some data, like cohorts data, are updated much earlier in the year so you can update that data independently from the rest of the database. 

## District boundaries and campus coordinates

TEA provides district boundaries and campus coordinates on [their open data site](https://schoolsdata2-tea-texas.opendata.arcgis.com/), which you can get to via the [School District Locator page](https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/general-information/school-district-locator). The latest district boundaries are listed under "Current Districts" and campus coordinates under "Current Campuses". Depending on what year you are updating for, you'll go to "Archived Schools Data" and click the school year you are updating for.

Put the GeoJSON boundaries and coordinates in the respective folder: `tapr/reference/district/shapes/` or `tapr/reference/campus/shapes/`.

### District boundaries
This was last updated for the 2022-23 school year. TEA provided the files as GeoJSONs. We don't display the actual shapes on the page because they're not accurate enough and may be misleading. They are useful for determining nearby districts and geolocating.

### Campus coordinates
This was last updated for the 2021-22 school year. TEA provided the files as GeoJSONs.

#### Older update instructions
The latest shapefile `campuses_03-10-2020.shp` (fetched March 10, 2020) is for the 2018-2019 school year. It was downloaded as an `.sd` file, and unzipped with Unarchiver (a Mac program). The unzipped version yields a `schools.gdb` folder, which can be opened in QGIS ([instructions](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/26285/installing-file-geodatabase-gdb-support-in-qgis)).

We convert the TEA provided shapefile into a geojson file using [`ogr2ogr`](http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html) with the command:

For school districts:

```sh
$ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 districts.geojson [tea-provided-file-name].shp
```

For campuses:

```sh
$ ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs crs:84 campuses.geojson [tea-provided-file-name].shp
```

## District and campus models

Each year, there's a possibility that campuses and districts change names, are added, or are removed. We rely on the `reference.csv` in each year's TAPR folder to create a `entities.csv` file that will create models for districts and campuses.

Instructions on how to take the `reference.csv` and create a new `entities.csv` are in the [`format_new_entities` Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole-data/blob/carla_readme_changes/format_new_entities.ipynb) â€” we should be doing this every year.

We do some district and campus name re-formatting in the Jupyter Notebook (i.e. Cayuga H S --> Cayuga High School). Abbreviations, the Regex for those abbreviations, and the string to replace them with are in `campus_name_abbrev_guidelines.xlsx`.

When you update entitites in [the scoule database](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole#updating-entities), you will be erasing the existing district and campus models and then re-adding every district and campus based on that `entities.csv`. This should take care of districts and schools that get renamed/removed/added.

## AskTED
**Released: as information is updated**

[AskTED](https://tealprod.tea.state.tx.us/tea.askted.web/Forms/Home.aspx) provides superintendents, principals and directory information for all schools and districts. The `scuole` repo downloads data from AskTED directly and updates them in our database, so there's no need to manually download and add them to `scuole-data`. 

Instructions on what commands to run to update AskTED are in the [`scuole` README](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole#updating-askted-data).

As of 2023, the AskTED data is found on their [site](https://tealprod.tea.state.tx.us/tea.askted.web/Forms/Home.aspx) if you click on [`Download School and District File with Site Address`](https://tealprod.tea.state.tx.us/Tea.AskTed.Web/Forms/DownloadSite.aspx). This ensures that we have school and district address for the site of the school and district office rather than the mailing addresses (which can be P.O. Boxes).

If the links above don't lead you to the correct data, then AskTED might have changed the link to the data. If so, then the commands to [update askTED data in the scuole database](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole#updating-askted-data) will fail, so make sure the links are updated with the correct headers names.

## TAPR
**Released: Annually in late November/early December**

All stats are collected by the [Texas Education Agency](http://tea.texas.gov/).

To download TAPR data, go to the [Texas Academic Performance Report homepage](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/) and find the most recent release. Click the `Data Download` link and go to the `Advanced TAPR Data (Numerators, Denominators & Rates)` option. 

This app requires sheets for `College, Career, and Military Readiness (CCMR), TSIA, College Prep`, `AP/IB, SAT/ACT`, `Attendance, Chronic Absenteeism, Graduation (RHSP/DAP & FHSP), and Dropout Rates`, `Longitudinal Rate (4-Year, 5-Year, & 6-Year)`, `Staff & Student Information` for Campus, District, Region and State. The `Reference Information, Accountability Rating and Special Education Determination Status` sheet is only required for Campus, District and Region.

For districts and campuses we need to download one extra file that contains the full A-F rankings. Go back one page and select 20xx Accountability instead. (The year will change depending on what year you're working on!). Download the `Accountability Summary` for Campus and Districts.

A detailed walkthrough on how to download and format the TAPR data is available [on this Confluence page](https://texastribune.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/163844/How+to+update+Public+Schools+2019).

After downloading each file, you will save it in their respective folders (Campus, District, Region, State) in their respective years as the following csvs. An example of the directory for Campus from 2021-22 found [here](tapr/2021-2022/campus/).

| TAPR data file | File name    | What it contains |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Accountability Summary      | accountability.csv       | A - F scores       |
| Reference Information, Accountability Rating and Special Education Determination Status      | reference.csv       | District and Campus Identifiers       |
| Staff, Student, and Annual Graduates   | staff-and-student-information.csv        | Student and Teacher data       |
| Attendance, Chronic Absenteeism, Graduation (RHSP/DAP & FHSP), and Dropout Rates   | attendance.csv        | Absenteeism and Dropout rates       |
| Longitudinal Rate (4-Year, 5-Year, & 6-Year)   | longitudinal-rate.csv        | Four year graduation rates       |
| College, Career, and Military Readiness (CCMR), TSIA, College Prep   | postsecondary-readiness-and-non-staar-performance-indicators.csv        | Texas Success Initiative Assessment (TSIA) scores       |
| AP/IB, SAT/ACT  | ap-ib-sat-act.csv        | AP/IB, SAT, ACT scores       |

### Cleaning the TAPR data

The TAPR data usually needs a cleaning before we run it in the [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole) database. The last couple of years, this is the cleaning we have needed to do:

- The campus, district and region codes should have a set number of digits, usually padded with leading zeroes. They are:
  - campus (9 digits)
  - district (6 digits)
  - region (2 digits)
  - county (3 digits)
- There's an unnecessary apostrophe added in the "DISTRICT", "COUNTY", "REGION" and "CAMPUS" columns

You have the option [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole-data/blob/master/Editing%20campus%2C%20district%2C%20region%20and%20county%20codes.ipynb) in this repository that uses the zfill() function to fill in all of the leading zeroes and also removes unnecessary apostrophes in their respective columns. Be sure to run it for the district, campus, region and state dataset. In addition, there is [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole-data/blob/master/delete_apostrophes.ipynb) that you only have to run once (although not sure if it runs the zfill() function for campuses and districts).

Also, for the 2021-22 TAPR data, the SAT and ACT headers had random letters that were lowercased. Make sure the column headers are capitalized. This step is written in both Python notebooks.

If you're unlucky to run into any other formatting errors, first of all (sorry!), second of all, try to write a solution in a Python notebook and add it to this README so it can be reproduced the following year and properly documented.

### Making sure TAPR header data matches

The headers for the data should match the schema found in [`schema_v2.py`](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole/blob/master/scuole/stats/schemas/tapr/schema_v2.py) which is what we use to map the data. If after uploading all of the data into the [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole) database, you notice there are fields missing. It could be because the header in the spreadsheet do not match the schema found in [`schema_v2.py`](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole/blob/master/scuole/stats/schemas/tapr/schema_v2.py). There are a lot of headers and columns so it might get tedious to check each and every one, especially since they don't tend to change year-to-year. But it might be worth checking if you see data missing. The [scuole](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole) database just skips those headers if it doesn't see a matching header and shows N/A in your local database.

Every year, TEA publishes a `Master reference of TAPR elements` like [this one from 2022](https://rptsvr1.tea.texas.gov/perfreport/tapr/2022/download/taprref.html). It's usually found in the TAPR Advanced Data Download for that year that you use to download the data and called `Master Reference (HTML)`. You can also download it in an Excel format for campuses, districts, regions and state. 

It's also good to remember that for some datasets, TAPR has the **latest data** while others are **a year behind**. For example, if this was the 2021-22 TAPR, the latest data would be for 2021-22 (or Class of 2022) and the previous year would be 2020-21 (or Class of 2021) Here's is a handy breakdown:

| Data     | TAPR Data File | Year |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| A-F scores     | Reference Information, Accountability Rating and Special Education Determination       | Latest year       |
| Student Demographics   | Staff, Student, and Annual Graduates       | Latest year       |
| At-risk, economically disadvantages and limited English proficiency students   | Staff, Student, and Annual Graduates       | Latest year       |
| Enrollments in special programs (bilingual/ESL, gifted & talented, special ed)   | Staff, Student, and Annual Graduates       | Latest year       |
| Four-year graduation rates   | Longitudinal Rate (4-Year, 5-Year, & 6-Year)       | Previous year       |
| Dropout rates   | Attendance, Graduation (RHSP/DAP & FHSP), and Dropout Rates       | Previous year       |
| Chronic absenteeism   | Attendance, Graduation (RHSP/DAP & FHSP), and Dropout Rates       | Previous year       |
| AP/IB participation   | AP/IB, SAT/ACT       | Previous year       |

## Cohorts
**Released: Annually in late April/early May**

The Texas Higher Ed Coordinating Board (THECB) and TEA provide data for the Higher Ed Outcomes section of the app. To obtain and clean the data:

1) First, [download the latest year of the data from THECB](http://www.txhighereddata.org/index.cfm?objectId=4E600400-D970-11E8-BB650050560100A9). The latest year should be 11 years from the current year.

2) Then, create a folder in the `cohorts/` folder. Name it the year (YYYY) to which the data corresponds. 

3) Open the spreadsheet. Unhide the `Master Raw Data` worksheet in the `.xlsx` file from THECB by going to `Format -> Sheet -> Unhide --> Master Raw Data`. 

4) For the last two years, however, the `Master Raw Data` worksheet has not been for the corresponding year. Check to see if it matches the year. If not, contact the Texas Higher Ed Coordinating Board right away so they can get you a spreadsheet of that `Master Raw Data`. 

5) Copy and paste that data into a new spreadsheet. Change the headers to match the list of fields in the loader, or copy and paste the headers from a previous year's data. Be sure the data matches the header, and save it as `regionState.csv`.

6) Copy and paste the data found in `Region Cty Gender`, `Region Cty Econ` and `Region Cty Ethnicity` into individual csv files. Name them `countyGender.csv`, `countyEcon.csv` and `countyEthnicity.csv`, respectively. Change the headers to match the list of fields in the loader, or copy and paste the headers from a previous year's data.

7) Be sure to remove any notes found at the top and bottom of all `.xlsx` files.

8) Make sure all counts are integers and all percents are floats (which requires changing them in Excel ðŸ˜¬).

9) When updating the latest cohorts data, I noticed that they're adding asterisk (*) and N/As into the datasets. We don't want that! We want them to be empty. I created a Jupyter notebook called [`clean_cohorts_data.ipynb`](clean_cohorts_data.ipynb) to help with any cleanup of that.
